# Grafida — AI assistant orientation

Grafida is a cross-platform **desktop application** (macOS, Windows, Linux) for creating
and editing **Joomla! articles** through the Joomla Web Services (REST) API. It is built in
**PHP 8.4** with [**Boson**](https://bosonphp.com), uses **SQLite** for all local storage,
and **TinyMCE 7** as the HTML editor. Licensed **GNU GPL v3 or later**. Dev happens on macOS.

## Scope (what we deliberately do NOT support)

Grafida is an **offline article editor**: it composes article HTML locally and publishes it
through the REST API. It is **not** the Joomla back-end and does **not** reuse the Joomla
WYSIWYG editor environment. Consequently we do **not** support — and will not try to emulate —
**page builders** (SP Page Builder, JSN, Quix, etc.), **editor-button/editor-xtd plugins**
(e.g. the article/image/page-break/module-insert buttons, sliders, tabs, third-party
shortcode buttons), or **custom/alternative media managers**. Article bodies are plain HTML
authored in TinyMCE; images go through Grafida's own offline media picker (see `src/Media/`),
not a site-side media-manager plugin. Don't add features that depend on server-side editor
plugins or builder shortcodes.

## How Boson works here (important)

Boson runs a native webview and bundles a PHP runtime. There is **no `webview->bind` RPC**.
Instead `index.php` registers a handler for the `boson://` scheme; every request is turned
into a PSR-style `Boson\Component\Http\Request` and answered with a `Response`. The
front-end (a plain HTML/CSS/JS SPA under `assets/private`) talks to PHP by calling
`fetch('boson://app/api/...')`.

Request flow: `index.php` → `Grafida\FrontController` → `Grafida\Application\Kernel`
(the composition root) → either `Grafida\Http\ApiController` (paths under `/api/`) or a
static asset / the SPA shell. **The kernel is a pure `Request → Response` function**, so the
whole back-end is testable without opening a window (see `tests/Feature/ApiRoutingTest.php`).

**File pickers must go through the native dialog, not `<input type="file">`.** Boson's
webview does not wire up the HTML file-input open-panel callback (WKWebView on macOS,
WebKitGTK on Linux), so an in-page `<input type="file">` `.click()` silently does nothing.
`index.php` therefore passes `$app->dialog` (Boson's `DialogApiInterface`) into the
`FrontController` → `Kernel` → `ApiController`, and the SPA opens files via `POST
/api/dialog/open-file` (`api.openFile(filter)`, filter `image`/`markdown`/`any`):
`ApiController::openFile()` calls `selectFile()`, reads the chosen file and returns
`{name, mime, dataBase64}` (or `{cancelled:true}`). `uploadLocalImage()` (intro/full-text
images, the in-editor/media-browser "Choose file…" button) and `importMarkdown()` consume
it. The dialog dependency is **nullable** so the kernel stays window-free in tests (a null
dialog makes the endpoint return 503).

## Layout

- `src/Http/` — `HttpClient` (curl/stream transport to Joomla), internal `ApiController`, `Json`.
- `src/Joomla/ApiClient.php` — Joomla REST client: base-URL normalisation + probing, JSON:API.
- `src/Secret/` — OS secret stores (macOS `security`, Linux `secret-tool`, Windows DPAPI) + factory.
- `src/Site/` — site entity, repository, `SiteService` (token storage + connection test).
  `FaviconService` (5s fetch) parses the site home page for `<link rel="icon">` / Apple
  touch icons, downloads the largest one (falling back to `/apple-touch-icon.png` then
  `/favicon.ico`), and caches the raw bytes in `site_favicons` (`FaviconRepository`).
  `sync()` is best-effort, run when a site is connected/updated (and on the manual metadata
  refresh); the cached icon is sent to the SPA as each site's `favicon` data: URI (in the
  `bootstrap`/sites payloads) and shown as a 64×64 rounded square on the Sites page and below
  the sidebar site dropdown.
- `src/Reference/` — cached categories/tags/levels/fields + `EditorCssService` (5s fetch, rebase, cache).
  `ReferenceService` uses a short-timeout (8s) API client; `sync()` warms the cache best-effort
  when a site is connected/updated, and opening the editor falls back to cache per-list (only the
  manual refresh button surfaces fetch errors).
- `src/Field/FieldSupport.php` — supported field-type subset + required-unsupported guard.
- `src/Article/` — `Draft` entity + repository (local drafts). A draft remembers the
  `site_id` + `remote_id` it mirrors; `findByRemote()` locates an existing draft for a
  remote article and `update()` can re-point a draft at another site (which unlinks it).
  Editing a remote article fetches its full content via `GET /api/sites/{id}/articles/{articleId}`
  (body recovered by `ApiController::remoteArticleBody()`: it prefers discrete `introtext` /
  `fulltext` attributes if the API ever exposes them — a Joomla PR proposes this — otherwise it
  falls back to the combined `text` attribute and heuristically splits intro/full on the
  `"\r\n \r\n"` separator Joomla inserts between them; the recovered split is re-emitted as the
  editor's `<hr class="readmore">` marker so it survives the round-trip to publishing; category
  and tags come from the JSON:API `relationships` block, which `ApiClient::flatten()` preserves,
  tag IDs resolved to titles) and
  opens it as an **unsaved** draft — drafts (new or imported) are only written to the DB on
  the first Save, so an unchanged remote article leaves no local draft.
  The remote-article list (`GET /api/sites/{id}/articles`) is a **paginated, sorted and
  filtered** browse, mirroring Joomla's back-end article list: `ApiController::remoteArticles()`
  reads `page`/`limit`/`ordering`/`direction` plus the supported filters (`search`, `category`,
  `tag`, `language`, `state`, `featured`, `checked_out`) from the query string, validates the
  sort column against a whitelist (`ARTICLE_ORDERING`, drawn from the model's `filter_fields`),
  and forwards them to the REST API as `list[ordering|direction]` + `filter[…]` + `page[limit|
  offset]`. `ApiClient::listArticlesPage()` returns the page's items **and** the pagination total
  (Joomla's `meta['total-pages']`). Default sort is `a.id` desc. The Articles page is split into
  two tabs — **Local Articles** and **Remote Articles** (`State.articlesTab`, default `drafts`;
  the user-facing label is “Local Articles” but the internal entity/state/routes remain *draft*) —
  each with its own filter/sort toolbar, list and prev/next pagination. The tab strip carries a
  right-aligned **network-activity indicator** (`#articles-net-indicator`): `apiFetch()` keeps a
  global in-flight-request counter (`netActivityCount`) and `updateNetActivityIndicator()` shows a
  spinner + the `GRAFIDA_MSG_LOADING` label while the counter is > 0, so it is clear whether data
  is still loading. The Remote Articles tab
  renders the server-paginated toolbar (search, sort column + direction, category/tag/language/
  state/featured/checked-out dropdowns, per-page limit, clear-filters). The Local Drafts tab
  offers the same shape, but drafts are loaded in full per visit and **searched/sorted/filtered/
  paginated entirely client-side** (`filteredSortedDrafts()` / `renderDraftsTab()`); its toolbar
  is the subset of fields a draft actually carries (search over title+alias; sort by id/title/
  category/language/state; category/tag/language/state filters; per-page limit) — no
  featured/checked-out/hits/author/date controls. Because drafts store tag *titles* (not ids),
  the drafts tab's tag filter matches on title. A remote article that
  is already mirrored by a local draft (same site + `remote_id`) **stays** in the remote list
  (it is not hidden), tagged with an extra `GRAFIDA_LBL_HAS_LOCAL_DRAFT` "Local article" badge and
  a left accent; clicking it opens the existing draft rather than re-importing the article
  (`openEditorFor()` reuses the matching draft). The API only accepts a
  **single** category/tag and an INT `state`, so there is no multi-select or "all states"; an
  author filter is omitted (no local user list).
- `src/Media/` — offline image blobs (`media_blobs`). `ApiClient::listMedia()` browses the
  site's Media Manager (`GET /v1/media/files`); `ApiController` exposes it as
  `GET /api/sites/{id}/media?path=…` and serves an offline blob's data: URI back to the SPA
  via `GET /api/media/{id}` (to preview a not-yet-published intro/full-text image).
  **Media Manager screen** — a full online manager for the site's Media Manager (a sidebar
  item `data-screen="media"`; works only while the site is connected). The SPA
  (`loadMediaScreen()` in `app.js`) seeds the root from `GET /api/sites/{id}/media/adapters`
  (the first adapter is the default filesystem; its `path` like `local-images:/` is the root),
  browses folders with the existing `browseMedia`, and renders a card grid (folders + **all**
  files, not only images) with breadcrumb navigation and an adapter switcher when >1 filesystem
  exists. Actions map onto com_media's REST CRUD (verified against 5.4 source — see Joomla API
  facts): upload (`POST …/media/files` → `ApiClient::uploadMedia` with `override`), create folder
  (`POST …/media/folder` → `createMediaFolder`, a POST with a path but no content), rename
  (`POST …/media/rename` → `renameMedia`, a PATCH on the item URL whose body carries the new
  path; the server derives the new path from the old so the item stays in its folder), delete
  (`DELETE …/media?path=…` → `deleteMedia`), and an in-app **image editor** (crop/resize/rotate/
  flip on a `<canvas>`, saved via `POST …/media/content` → `updateMediaContent`, a PATCH that
  sends the same path + new base64 content). The editor loads the source bytes through the
  backend (`GET …/media/file` → `getMediaFile`, returning a data: URI) so the canvas is **not**
  tainted by a cross-origin `<img>` (which would block `toBlob`); it only opens raster types
  (`png`/`jpg`/`jpeg`/`webp`). PATCH/DELETE put the adapter-qualified path in the **URL segment**
  (`v1/media/files/:path`, route pattern `.*`), so `ApiClient::mediaItemUrl()` keeps `/` and `:`
  literal and percent-encodes the rest.
- `src/Html/` — `ContentSplitter` (read-more split), `CssRebaser`, `InlineMedia`, `HtmlDocument`.
- `src/Publish/PublishService.php` — the publish pipeline (media upload, tags, fields, split, POST/PATCH).
  After a successful publish the SPA (`showPostPublishDialog()`) asks what to do with the local
  draft: **Delete Local Article** (the default/focused action — removes the draft and returns to the list,
  the published article remaining in the remote list) or **Keep Local Article** (leaves the editor open to
  edit and re-publish). A draft's `images` object holds Joomla's eight `image_intro*` / `image_fulltext*` subfields; the
  intro/full-text image picked from a local file is stored as a `grafida-media://N` sentinel that
  `resolveImages()` uploads (via the shared offline-blob upload) and swaps for a public URL on publish.
  The SPA's editor "Images" section lets you pick a local file, browse the site's media, or paste a URL,
  and includes Joomla's `image_*_alt_empty` "decorative image" toggle. The same picker backs TinyMCE's
  Insert/Edit Image dialog: its Source-field browse button (`file_picker_callback`, gated by
  `file_picker_types: 'image'`) opens the media browser, with a "Choose file…" button for a local file.
  To **edit an already-inserted image** (dimensions, description, alignment, CSS), selecting it shows a
  floating context toolbar (`addContextToolbar('grafidaImageTools')`, predicate = `img`) whose **Image**
  item re-opens that same dialog; the dialog carries the Dimensions fields (`image_dimensions`) and an
  Advanced tab (`image_advtab`: inline style, border, spacing). Double-clicking the image or the
  toolbar/Insert-menu **Image** button work too. The same context toolbar's **CSS class…** item
  (`imageclass` button) opens a small prompt to set any free-text CSS class(es) on the image (the
  Insert/Edit Image dialog has no class field); it pre-fills the current `class` and writes it back in one
  undo step (empty clears it). The editor `content_style` also forces
  `img { max-width: 100%; height: auto }`: Joomla bakes a photo's full intrinsic size into the tag (e.g.
  `width="4032"`), and without a constraining rule the picture overflows the editor's scroll box and becomes
  un-clickable in the WKWebView (broken hit-testing) — scaling it to fit keeps it selectable/editable, and
  only the editor view is affected (the published `width`/`height` are untouched).
  TinyMCE's own **"Upload" tab is disabled** (`image_uploadtab: false`) because its "Browse for an image"
  dropzone creates a plain `<input type="file">` that Boson's webview never opens (see the native
  file-dialog note above) — so local uploads go exclusively through the Source-field "Choose file…",
  which calls the native picker.
  a local pick is inserted as `<img src="data:…" data-grafida-media-id="N">` (`GRAFIDA_MEDIA_ATTR`,
  mirroring `InlineMedia::ATTRIBUTE`) so `PublishService` uploads it on publish; a site-media pick is
  inserted as its public URL. On publish, `InlineMedia::rewriteDataImages()` rewrites **every** inline
  `data:` image — not just tagged ones: an image **pasted or dropped straight into the editor** (e.g. from
  a web page or another app) never passes through the in-editor upload handler, so it carries no
  `data-grafida-media-id`; `PublishService::uploadInlineImage()` decodes and stores such an untagged data:
  URI on the fly so it is uploaded too, instead of leaking a giant broken inline blob into the published
  HTML. A media upload that fails (or returns no usable result) aborts the publish with a clear error.
  Each uploaded image is rebuilt as the **same `<img>` Joomla's own media field emits** —
  `<img src="images/…" width=… height=… loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/…">` (`mediaInfo()`): a
  site-root-relative `src`, the intrinsic `width`/`height`, and the `data-path` adapter linkage to the
  Media-Manager entry. **The upload path is relative to the default Media adapter's root** (`grafida/<file>`,
  NOT `images/grafida/<file>`): the default `local-images` adapter is rooted at the site's `images/`
  directory, so an `images/`-prefixed path writes the file to `images/images/grafida/…` while the article
  still points at `images/grafida/…` — a broken image. After a successful media upload `PublishService`
  also **writes the rewritten HTML back into the local draft** (so the stored draft mirrors what was
  published and a re-publish does not upload the images again); `data-path` is added to the editor's
  `extended_valid_elements` so it survives a TinyMCE round-trip.
- `src/Display/DisplayModeService.php` — persists the interface display-mode preference
  (`auto`/`light`/`dark`) in `settings`; sent to the SPA as the `bootstrap` payload's
  `displayMode` key and written via `POST /api/settings/display-mode`. Because Boson's
  webview does **not** report `prefers-color-scheme` reliably (on macOS it always reports
  dark), `systemPrefersDark()` probes the OS appearance directly (macOS `defaults read -g
  AppleInterfaceStyle`, Windows `AppsUseLightTheme` registry DWORD, Linux gsettings
  `color-scheme`/`gtk-theme`) → `true`/`false`/`null` when undetectable; it is sent in the
  `bootstrap` payload as `systemPrefersDark` and re-probed on demand via
  `GET /api/settings/system-theme`. The SPA's `systemPrefersDark()` trusts that value to
  resolve `auto`, only falling back to the media query when it is `null`, and re-probes on
  window `focus` so `auto` follows OS theme changes at runtime; it sets
  `<html data-theme="light|dark">`;
  TinyMCE follows the app theme (skin `oxide`/`oxide-dark`); its editing surface switches to
  the dark built-in content CSS only when the site supplies no `editor.css`.
- `src/Markdown/`, `src/I18n/`, `src/Storage/` — Markdown import, language service, SQLite + migrations.
  `StorageService` reports the DB file path, opens its folder in the OS file browser
  (`open`/`explorer`/`xdg-open`), and resets local storage (deletes tokens + wipes all
  tables, keeping `schema_migrations`). Exposed under `/api/settings/storage[/open|/reset]`.
- `src/Support/` — `Resources`/`Paths` (filesystem locations), `App` (app identity/legal
  metadata: name, `VERSION`, copyright, licence + FSF URL, the verbatim Joomla! trademark
  disclaimer — sent to the SPA in the `bootstrap` payload's `app` key), and `UrlOpener`
  (opens an external http(s) URL in the OS default browser; backs `POST /api/open-url`).
  The sidebar footer shows the version and opens an About dialog using this metadata.
- `assets/private/` — SPA (`view/index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, vendored `js/tinymce/`).
  UI icons use the vendored **FontAwesome 7 Free** solid font (`css/fontawesome.min.css`
  + `css/solid.min.css` + `webfonts/fa-solid-900.woff2`) — never images/emoji. Action
  buttons carry a leading `<i class="fa-solid fa-…" aria-hidden="true">` before the label;
  in `app.js` use the `icon()` / `iconBtn()` helpers. Source-code editing uses vendored
  **CodeMirror 5** (`js/codemirror/`: `lib/` + `mode/{xml,javascript,css,htmlmixed}` +
  `addon/edit/{matchbrackets,closetag}` + the `material-darker` dark theme) instead of
  TinyMCE's stock `code` plugin: that plugin is dropped from the `plugins` list, and a
  custom `sourcecode` toolbar button + Tools-menu item (registered in the editor `setup`)
  opens `openSourceCodeEditor()` — a `showModal()` dialog hosting a CodeMirror `htmlmixed`
  editor (light `default` / dark `material-darker` theme, matched to `State.resolvedTheme`).
  Save writes the source back via `editor.setContent(…, {source_view: true})` in one undo step.
  The toolbar also carries a **"Styles" drop-down** (`styleselect`, a custom `addMenuButton`
  registered in `setup`) that applies a CSS class to the selection the way Joomla's editor does.
  Its class list is `editorStyleClasses()` — class names `parseEditorCssClasses()` discovers in the
  site's cached `editor.css` **plus** a small built-in `EDITOR_CLASS_DEFAULTS` fallback set (deduped,
  alphabetical). Application is automatic: a non-collapsed text selection is wrapped in a
  `<span class="…">` (an `inline` format), a mere cursor sets the class on the enclosing block (a
  `selector` format over common block/img/anchor tags — it never changes the tag). Each class is
  pre-registered as a `grafidaInline_N` / `grafidaBlock_N` format pair in the init `formats` option;
  menu items are toggles whose active state mirrors `editor.formatter.match()`.
  The active site is remembered client-side in `localStorage` (`grafida.lastSiteId`, via
  `rememberLastSite()` / `recallLastSite()`); it is not persisted server-side. On startup
  `bootstrap()` opens the **Articles** page (instead of **Sites**) when at least one site is
  defined and a previously remembered last active site is still in the list — the remembered id
  is read *before* `renderSiteSelector()` writes its first-site fallback, so a freshly added but
  never-selected site does not trigger the Articles default.
- `language/<tag>/<tag>.com_grafida.ini` + `language/grafida.xml` — translations + manifest.
  The shipped-language list is **not** hard-coded: `LanguageService::available()` discovers it at
  runtime by scanning `language/` for every `<tag>/<tag>.com_grafida.ini` and reading that file's
  `GRAFIDA_LANGUAGE_ENDONYM` key (the language's name in its own tongue) for the label; the default
  (en-GB) sorts first, the rest by endonym. So every `.ini` MUST carry `GRAFIDA_LANGUAGE_ENDONYM`,
  and adding a translation needs no code change (the list is sent to the SPA as `bootstrap`'s
  `availableLanguages` tag => endonym map).
- `storage/migrations/*.sql` — schema. `.plans/` — implementation step notes (gitignored).
- `build/glossaries/` — per-language translation glossaries.
- `build/icon/` — application icon. `grafida.svg` is the **single master** (clipart pencil
  drawing a capital “J”); `scripts/make-icons.sh` rasterises it into `Grafida.icns` (macOS),
  `Grafida.ico` (Windows), a `png/` set + `grafida.png` (Linux), all committed. Wiring:
  `make-macos-app.sh` copies the `.icns` into the bundle + `Info.plist` (`CFBundleIconFile`);
  the Windows installer bundles the `.ico` beside `grafida.exe`; Linux ships `grafida.desktop`
  + a hicolor PNG. `build/` is otherwise gitignored — the whitelisted exceptions are
  `build/icon/`, `build/glossaries/`, and the two packaging sources `build/linux-install.sh`
  + `build/windows-installer.nsi` (see `build/.gitignore`). Re-run make-icons after editing the SVG.

## Build & packaging (one step)

`composer build` → `scripts/build-all.sh` is the **one-shot** compile-and-package pipeline; it
runs `boson compile` (every target in `boson.json`) then packages each platform into
**`build/dist/`** (gitignored). The version comes from `App::VERSION` (override via
`GRAFIDA_VERSION`). Per-platform packaging is tolerant (missing binary → warn+skip), but a
failing compile or a genuine packaging-tool error is fatal. Pieces:
- macOS (arm64+amd64, macOS host only): `scripts/make-macos-app.sh <arch>` assembles
  `build/macos/<bosondir>/Grafida.app` (the bare binary + dylib + `assets/`, Info.plist,
  ad-hoc dylib signature) — Boson names the arm64 dir `aarch64`, amd64 stays `amd64` — then
  `scripts/make-dmg.sh <arch>` wraps it (via `hdiutil`) into `Grafida-<v>-macos-<arch>.dmg`
  with an `/Applications` symlink.
- Linux (amd64+arm64): a `.tar.gz` of the per-arch output dir (binary + `libboson-linux-*.so`
  + `assets/`) plus the icon, `grafida.desktop`, and `build/linux-install.sh` (renamed
  `install.sh`) — a per-user XDG desktop-integration installer.
- Windows (amd64): `build/windows-installer.nsi` compiled by **NSIS** `makensis`, which runs
  natively on macOS/Linux (no Wine/Docker/Windows) → `Grafida-<v>-windows-amd64-Setup.exe`
  (per-user install in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Grafida`). Falls back to a portable `.zip` if
  `makensis` is absent.
- PHAR: the compiler's `build/phar/grafida.phar`, copied to `Grafida-<v>.phar`.

## Key Joomla API facts (verified against Joomla 5.4 source)

- API base is reliably `{siteRoot}/index.php/api`; the rewrite form `{siteRoot}/api` needs
  server rules. `ApiClient` normalises any pasted URL to the bare root and **probes** to find
  the working base, persisting it per site.
- Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (also sends `X-Joomla-Token`). User needs `core.login.api`.
- Articles: `POST/PATCH /v1/content/articles[/{id}]`. **Write bodies are a flat
  top-level JSON object of field values** — Joomla's JSON:API `{data:{type,attributes}}`
  envelope is for *responses only*; wrapping a write makes Joomla bind nothing and
  silently return the unchanged resource (a PATCH no-op). The record id for an update
  comes from the URL, not the body. Send the body as the discrete `introtext` /
  `fulltext` columns — **not** the combined `articletext` field. On a PATCH the API
  controller backfills every real DB column we omit from the *existing* record, and
  `Content::bind()` ends with `parent::bind()`, overwriting the introtext/fulltext it
  derives from `articletext` with the backfilled OLD values — so a PATCH that sends
  only `articletext` silently reverts the body (a create has no backfill, so it worked).
  Sending `introtext`/`fulltext` keeps them present in the data, never backfilled.
  Custom field values go under `com_fields`. Tags
  are an array of IDs. (`ApiClient::send()` posts the flat body; only responses are unwrapped.)
- Media upload: `POST /v1/media/files` with `{path, content:<base64>}`; the response `url` is public.

## Conventions

- Every PHP file starts with the GPLv3 copyright docblock. `declare(strict_types=1)`.
- `composer test` runs the suite; `composer linter:check` runs PHPStan (level max + strict rules).
- Add new UI strings to `language/en-GB/en-GB.com_grafida.ini` (canonical) and the `UI_KEYS`
  list in `ApiController`, then translate. **See the translation flow below.**
- Never build a localised sentence by concatenating fragments around an injected value — word
  order differs per language. Keep each message a single string with `%s` placeholders and
  interpolate in the SPA with `formatNodes(t('KEY'), node)` (returns text/DOM nodes to spread
  into `el()`), mirroring Joomla's `Text::sprintf()`.

## Translation flow (must be followed every time)

The canonical source is **en-GB**. Translations use the **Joomla INI** format. Before each
translation run, consult the per-language glossary in `build/glossaries/<tag>.md` (create it
if missing) and update it with any new terms — glossaries keep terminology consistent. After
creating each `<tag>.com_grafida.ini` (and `.sys.ini`), register the language in
`language/grafida.xml`. Each `<tag>.com_grafida.ini` MUST include a `GRAFIDA_LANGUAGE_ENDONYM`
key holding the language's name in its own tongue (e.g. `"Français (France)"`) — `LanguageService`
reads it to build the runtime language list, so the new language appears in the UI automatically.
When a generated file is large, write it in ~10–12 KiB chunks, each
ending on a whole line. The shipped languages are: en-GB (source), el-GR, fr-FR, de-DE,
es-ES, it-IT, pt-PT.
